# Crag Weather App
User Story: I want to be able to view all local crag weather on one page to make planning climbing trips easier. 
Other alternatives require constant refreshing or several tabs to view the different areas.

## About
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) components and the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API for weather data. 

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## What's Next?
- Ability to add custom crags
- User accounts to store crags
- Cron job to get crag weather to reduce API calls
- Click on crags for hourly weather
- Much more
